Using Pycharm for Django
===========================

Python has a few options for virtual development environment management.
My favorite tool is pipenv. I'd like to use pipenv as much as possible.

I configured my pipenv in my Pycharm.

My python is installed in `~/.asdf`. Refer to [here](https://asdf-vm.com/) about `asdf`.

I never install python and dependencies globally. (It applies to other languages as well.)
