Python has name a few options for virtual development environment management.
My favorite tool is pipenv, since it has similar feel to other modern dependency management tools. 

Here is how to configure pipenv in Pycharm.

I manage python versions with asdf. Refer to [here](https://asdf-vm.com/), if you are intested in asdf. Key is that you can keep your environment clean. installing Python globally can cause unexpected side effects.
