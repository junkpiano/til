title: Use .zprofile over .zshrc

I ran into `PATH` issue on MacVim(GUI vim for MacOS).
What I found after I googled around is using `.zprofile` over `.zshrc`.

I put `.zprofile` which is a really simple one.

```
if [ -f ~/.zshrc ]; then
    . ~/.zshrc
fi
```

I let `.zprofile` reads `.zshrc` to avoid duplicate variable definitions.

A major difference in both files is the shells in which startup files are read.

| file | shell |
|----|----|
| .zshrc | interactive shell |
| .zprofile | login shell |

When we use terminal, such as Terminal, iTerm, zsh is run in interactive shell. 
However, [MacVim is running non-interactive shell](https://github.com/b4winckler/macvim/wiki/Troubleshooting#for-zsh-users). Therefore, user-defined paths in `.zshrc` won't be read on MacVim
