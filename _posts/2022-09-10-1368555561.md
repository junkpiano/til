Split function is frequent used but C++ doesn't provide build-in function.

Here is a sample implementation.

```c++
vector<int> split(string s) {
    vector<string> list;
    int offset = 0;
    string delimiter = ","
    size_t delimiter_size = delimiter.length();

    while(1) {
        int pos = s.find(delimiter, offset); // 1
            
        if (pos == string::npos) { // 2
            list.push_back(s.substr(offset)); // 3
            break;
        }
        
        list.push_back(s.substr(offset, pos - offset)); // 4
        offset = pos + delimiter_size; // 5
    }
}
```

1. is to find the **first** delimiter and get the position from the offset.
2. is to check the position is the end of string or not.
3. gets substring of the last string element from the last delimiter position to the end of the string.
4. gets substring from current offset to the delimiter position that we got in 1.
5. advances offset by delimiter position plus delimiter length.
