title: Fixing ‚ÄúTimestamp was ahead of the server‚Äôs time‚Äù on WSL2

While working on an API integration, I kept hitting an annoying error:

```
Error: Timestamp for this request was 1000ms ahead of the server's time.
```

Even after enabling NTP sync inside my Ubuntu WSL2 environment with `chrony` or `timedatectl`, the error persisted. It turned out the real culprit was **the Windows host clock**.

## Why does this happen?

* Some APIs are very strict about request timestamps.
* If your local clock is even **1 second ahead**, requests can be rejected.
* In WSL2, the Linux subsystem doesn‚Äôt manage its own hardware clock. Instead, it **inherits the system time from the Windows host**.
* So even if Ubuntu inside WSL2 says `System clock synchronized: yes`, if Windows itself is out of sync, your requests will fail.

## The Fix: Sync Windows, Not Just WSL2

1. Open **PowerShell as Administrator**.

2. Restart and resync the Windows Time service:

   ```powershell
   Start-Service W32Time
   w32tm /config /update
   w32tm /resync /force
   ```

3. Verify status:

   ```powershell
   w32tm /query /status
   ```

   You should see something like:

   ```
   Stratum: 2
   Precision: -23 (119.209ns per tick)
   Last Successful Sync Time: ...
   ```

4. (Optional) Set reliable NTP servers:

   ```powershell
   w32tm /config /manualpeerlist:"time.windows.com,0x9 time.google.com,0x9" /syncfromflags:manual /update
   w32tm /resync /force
   ```

5. Restart WSL2 if needed:

   ```powershell
   wsl.exe --shutdown
   ```

## Lessons Learned

* **In WSL2, your Linux clock is only as good as your Windows clock.**
* Don‚Äôt waste hours debugging `timedatectl` or `chrony` if you‚Äôre still seeing errors.
* Sync your Windows host with NTP ‚Üí restart WSL2 ‚Üí problem solved.

## Conclusion

If you‚Äôre building anything time-sensitive on WSL2 and run into the dreaded **‚ÄúTimestamp ahead‚Äù** error:
üëâ **Fix your Windows time sync, not just Ubuntu.**

It saved me from endless frustration, and now my scripts run flawlessly.
