```
systeminfo | findstr /I type:
```

1. `systeminfo`: This is a built-in command in Windows that displays detailed configuration information about a computer and its operating system. This includes details like the OS name, version, manufacturer, system uptime, and more.
2. `findstr /I type:`: The findstr command is used to search for strings in text. The /I switch makes the search case-insensitive. The string "type:" is what findstr is searching for in the output of systeminfo.
