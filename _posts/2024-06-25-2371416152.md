## Understanding Lima-VM
Lima-VM is a virtual machine manager that can be used to run Linux on macOS or other operating systems. It is often used to provide a Docker-compatible environment for development. For more details, visit the [Lima-VM GitHub page](https://github.com/lima-vm/lima).

## Install Lima-VM with Homebrew
Open your terminal.
Install Lima and Docker using Homebrew by running:

```
brew install lima docker
```

This command installs both Lima-VM and Docker, setting up your system for running Docker containers within a Lima-VM instance.

## Download docker.yaml

From [example](https://github.com/lima-vm/lima/tree/master/examples),
```
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lima-vm/lima/master/examples/docker.yaml
```

## Start Lima Virtual Machine
Once you have the docker.yaml file, you can start the Lima virtual machine with the following command:

```
limactl start ./docker.yaml
```

This command tells Lima to start a virtual machine using the configuration specified in docker.yaml.

## Login to the Lima VM Shell
To interact with the Docker environment running inside your Lima-VM, use:

```
limactl shell docker
```

This command opens a shell session inside the Lima virtual machine where Docker is running.

By following these steps, you'll have a functional Docker environment running inside Lima-VM on your system, suitable for containerized application development and testing.
