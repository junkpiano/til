The integrated Bluetooth adapter leaves much to be desired. I'm currently using an AMD AM5 motherboard equipped with the RZ616 Bluetooth(R) Adapter. While this motherboard also boasts an excellent Wi-Fi network adapter, the Bluetooth connection performance falls short.

To address this issue, I turned to a TP-Link Bluetooth 5 adapter, which has proven to be a reliable alternative. To make it work effectively, I decided to disable the onboard Bluetooth adapter, as it's not possible for both the BT dongle and the built-in BT adapter to coexist seamlessly.

Here are the steps to disable the onboard Bluetooth adapter:

Open the "Device Manager."

Locate the Bluetooth adapter in the list.

Right-click on the Bluetooth adapter and select "Disable."

Confirm the action, which will prompt your computer to restart.

After the restart, your computer should recognize the BT dongle and enable it automatically, providing you with improved Bluetooth connectivity.

In this revised version, the essay maintains a clear and straightforward structure, making it easier for readers to follow the troubleshooting steps. Additionally, the title has been adjusted to be more descriptive and relevant to the content.
