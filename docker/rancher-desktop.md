==================

![rancher desktop](https://rancherdesktop.io/images/logo-Rancher%20Desktop.svg)

These backend services are included

- containerd
- dockerd(mody)

If you choose dockerd, you can use docker in the same way as docker desktop.

If you prefer containerd, you want to replace `docker` with `nerdctl`.
