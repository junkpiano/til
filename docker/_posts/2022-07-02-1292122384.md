title: Instant `docker run`

When you want to just run a simple script inside Docker, it's quite convenient for you to memorize these docker commands and options.

```
$ docker build -t your-docker-image .
$ docker run -it --rm your-docker-image
```

## Break down options

- `-it`: for interactive processes, you must use `-i` and `-t` together to allocate a tty for the container process.
- `--rm`: automatically clean up container and remove the file system when the container exits.
